    "\n",
    "in our `overall approach` we decided to use the per property dataset which includes the property listed(from 2015 to 2024) after training and testing multiple models on a per property bases and model with the highest accuracy(XGboost in this case) was used to forcast. For the forcasting the chosen model trained on all the training data to then predict over for 2025 - 2027, the prediction in this case was done over all the training data with the changed year,forcasted population density for the year of prediction and forcasted crime density for the year of prediction taken into account, furthermore after getting the prediction, the predictions were aggregated(mean) by suburbs then the growth was calculated for each suburb using the predicted values of 2025 and 2027 for all the valid suburbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Problems we faced) Due to the imblance of suburbs listing over time, the aggregation(mean) by suburb before predictions would have lost alot of information related to the property, hence we felt would not have been ideal when forcasting over 2025-2027. hence we chose to to predict on a per property bases before aggregating the prediction per suburb to forcast for 2025-2027.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In `Training and testing for all models`, we decided to split our training and testing by time since we wanted to measure the ability of the model to forcast forward based the past historical rent properties, hence before we forcasted the using the models we first used the training(data before 2022) then evaluated it on (the property data after 2022). after that we used metrics such as MSE and R^2 we use the model with the better accuracy to forcast(Asumption: Making the assumption that models that performed better on train and testing data will perform better during forcasting as well...)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Metrics used`\n",
    "\n",
    "- we used `R^2` as metric to check how well the model variable explains the variance of the rent, it is used as a goodness of fit measure\n",
    "- We used `MSE` as metric to check the average error between the predicted and the actual rent values in the testing scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "(Assumption & limitation & Problem we faced) Since the whole property dataset was used to forcast(with change of the year feature,forcasted population density,forcasted Crime density), we made assumptions that the overall propertions of property type, bedroom and bathrooms would stay the same over the years, since randomising this would have resulted in a loss of information. furthermore since some suburbs did not have lisiting over some years, and there was bias of the number of listings from each susburb, hence this is another reason we used the whole modified dataset for prediction, this resulted in the forcast of all the listings in the suburbs, to be more accurate after aggregations(mean) since we used all the listing per suburbs with modified values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(Assumptions) We eliminated all the properties, that were in suburbs with less than 40 listings since we felt that would have increased bias,variance, harming our model and forc asting accuracy overall.\n",
